Provides a namespace and a class definition for the custom Element, including its constructor, destructor, initialize, and terminate methods.

The constructor takes a shared pointer to a Sol::Core instance and initializes a weak_ptr member variable, allowing the custom Element to have a weak reference to the Core.

The initialize method is used for setting up the custom Element and should be called after calling Core's attachElement function.

Custom functionality can be added to the Element as needed.

The terminate method is responsible for deallocating resources associated with the custom Element and should be called when amending Core's detachElement function and inside Core's terminate function.

The custom Element can include methods for accessing or interacting with its managed objects, if needed.

The Element's header file includes necessary includes, forward declarations, and pragma directives to prevent multiple inclusions.

Ensure the attach and detach Element functions of the Core are modified to allow attaching and detaching of the Element. Also ensure a get method is introduced to the Core.
