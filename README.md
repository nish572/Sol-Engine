# Sol-Engine

To run Sol, please download the latest release from the sidebar. Open the directory and find the Sol Engine.exe. Run this file to run Sol. Please ensure SDL2.dll and Engine.dll are present in the same directory (alternatively install to PATH, however for ease of use it is ideal to keep these .dll files in the same directory as the executable). Additionally, ensure the imgui configuration file is present in this same directory to allow the Editor to load with the same visual settings as I have set.

If running Sol in the Visual Studio solution debugger, please ensure SDL2.dll is copied and pasted directly into the appropriate directory (or installed to PATH).
For running the Visual Studio solution for the Debug-x64 configuration, this SDL2.dll should be pasted inside the following directory: "\Sol-Engine\Sol-Engine\bin\Debug-x64\Editor".
For running the Visual Studio solution for the Release-x64 configuration, this SDL2.dll should be pasted inside the following directory: "\Sol-Engine\Sol-Engine\bin\Release-x64\Editor".
Please note that the specific location of the Sol-Engine root directory will vary depending on where you download this codebase to.
